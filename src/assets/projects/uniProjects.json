It takes almost 4 months of time to complete this project which includes project idea, UI design, development & deployment. The main idea of this project is to make life easier for travel agencies & travelers by hosting all tour events on one platform. This platform also contains various countries, places, tour categories information & a separate dashboard for tour guides & travel agencies from which agencies can create their events.",
